### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After obtaining a Master's degree in Information Systems Management and gaining initial experience in the IT field as a business analyst, I decided to pivot towards a more technical path. That's why I recently completed the Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp. Now, I am actively seeking a position as a junior software engineer.
