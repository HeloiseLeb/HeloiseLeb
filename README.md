### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After completing a Master's in Information Systems Management and gaining initial experience in the IT world as a project manager, I wanted to acquire additional technical skills by learning coding. This would enable me to better understand and communicate with developers. That's why I recently I have just completed the Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp and am now actively seeking a position as a project manager.
